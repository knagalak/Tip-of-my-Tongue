### Tip of my Tongue was one of the Top 12 hacks at <a href="https://devpost.com/software/tip-of-my-tongue">MHacks Nano</a>. I worked on the project by myself.

hddsjfgsjEveryone comes across a situation while messaging or sending an email where you just cannot seem to find the right set of words. For me, at least, I sometimes can't think of a specific word for a couple of days and I always wished there was something to help me out. A thesaurus can only help me to an extent and sometimes it is never specific. Well, Tip of my Tongue is here to solve my problem and yours too!

## What the Tip of My Tongue knows aka What it does
This Facebook messenger bot helps you find the right word without having to look anywhere else. Just type in the things that you remember such as the starting letter, ending letter, meaning, associated words, rhyming words, homophones etc.. If you think a bit more, with its capabilities, you can find words for a quick game of scrabble, crossword puzzles, rhyming words for poets etc.. !
